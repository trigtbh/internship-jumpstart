# PROJECT SPECIFICATION

## Password Security Toolkit

**Project Code:** RUST-SEC-004  
**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Team:** Security Engineering  
**Stakeholder:** CISO Office & User Education

-----

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Following recent security incidents industry-wide, we need to help our users create stronger passwords. This toolkit will be integrated into our user onboarding process and made available as a standalone utility for employees to assess and improve their password security posture.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Build a comprehensive password security tool that helps users understand password strength, identifies weak passwords, and generates cryptographically secure passwords that meet various policy requirements.

## BUSINESS CONTEXT

**Problem Statement:**

- 60% of security breaches involve weak or reused passwords
- Users struggle to create memorable yet secure passwords
- Our current password policies are inconsistently enforced
- No tooling exists to help users assess password strength before setting them

**Expected Impact:**

- Reduce password-related security incidents by 40%
- Improve user awareness of password security
- Standardize password generation across the organization

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Must Have (P0)

#### Password Strength Checker

- **FR-1:** Analyze password and assign strength score (0-100)
- **FR-2:** Check for common patterns (qwerty, 12345, password123, etc.)
- **FR-3:** Evaluate password length (score increases with length)
- **FR-4:** Check character diversity (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols)
- **FR-5:** Detect common dictionary words
- **FR-6:** Provide specific feedback on weaknesses

#### Password Generator

- **FR-7:** Generate random passwords of configurable length
- **FR-8:** Include/exclude character types by user preference
- **FR-9:** Use cryptographically secure random generation
- **FR-10:** Generate multiple password options in one command
- **FR-11:** Ensure generated passwords meet minimum security requirements

### Should Have (P1)

- **FR-12:** Check against list of 1000 most common passwords
- **FR-13:** Detect keyboard patterns (qwertyuiop, asdfghjkl)
- **FR-14:** Detect repeated characters (aaa, 111)
- **FR-15:** Calculate entropy bits
- **FR-16:** Generate memorable passphrases (4-6 random words)
- **FR-17:** Estimate time to crack based on strength

### Nice to Have (P2)

- **FR-18:** Interactive mode (keep generating until user satisfied)
- **FR-19:** Password strength comparison tool
- **FR-20:** Export passwords to password manager format

## SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**

- **SEC-1:** Use cryptographically secure random number generation (`rand::rngs::OsRng`)
- **SEC-2:** Never log or persist passwords to disk
- **SEC-3:** Clear password from memory after use (if possible)
- **SEC-4:** No network calls (fully offline tool)
- **SEC-5:** Warn users about shoulder-surfing when displaying passwords

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Technology

- **Language:** Rust (latest stable version)
- **Required Crates:**
  - `rand` - for secure random generation
  - `clap` - for CLI argument parsing (optional but recommended)

### Password Strength Algorithm

Scoring criteria (0-100 scale):

- Length: +5 points per character beyond 8
- Character diversity: +15 points each (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols)
- Not in common passwords list: +20 points
- No keyboard patterns: +10 points
- No repeated sequences: +10 points

Strength categories:

- 0-30: Weak (red)
- 31-60: Medium (yellow)
- 61-80: Strong (green)
- 81-100: Very Strong (bright green)

### Common Passwords List

Include at least these (expand to 100+ for P1):

```
password, 123456, qwerty, admin, letmein, welcome,
monkey, dragon, master, sunshine, princess, etc.
```

## USER INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS

### Command Structure

```bash
# Check password strength
passec check

# Generate password with defaults (16 chars, all types)
passec generate

# Generate with options
passec generate --length 20 --count 5 --no-symbols

# Generate passphrase
passec passphrase --words 5
```

### Example Interaction - Checking

```
$ passec check
Enter password to check: ********

Password Strength: 45/100 (MEDIUM)

Issues found:
 ⚠ Contains common word: "password"
 ⚠ No uppercase letters
 ⚠ No numbers
 ✓ Good length (12 characters)

Suggestions:
 • Add uppercase letters
 • Include numbers
 • Avoid dictionary words
 • Consider using symbols

Estimated crack time: 2 hours (with modern GPU)
```

### Example Interaction - Generating

```
$ passec generate --length 16 --count 3

Generated secure passwords:
1. k#9Lm*xQ2vB@nP4w
2. R7$tY3*mN9@aK5xJ
3. zF8*dG2#pL6@hW9q

Copy one of these passwords to use.
⚠ Make sure no one is looking over your shoulder!
```

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. ✅ Password checker accurately identifies weak passwords
1. ✅ Generated passwords meet security requirements
1. ✅ Uses cryptographically secure randomness
1. ✅ CLI is intuitive and user-friendly
1. ✅ All P0 requirements implemented
1. ✅ No passwords written to logs or disk
1. ✅ Helpful error messages and usage instructions
1. ✅ Code compiles without warnings

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Test Cases - Password Checking

- “password123” → Should be flagged as weak
- “P@ssw0rd!” → Should detect common pattern despite modifications
- “MySecureP@ssw0rd2024!” → Should rate as strong
- “aaaaaa” → Should detect repeated characters
- “qwertyuiop” → Should detect keyboard pattern
- Random 20-char mixed → Should rate as very strong

### Test Cases - Password Generation

- Generated passwords have correct length
- Generated passwords include requested character types
- Multiple generations produce different results
- Generated passwords pass strength check with score > 80

## DELIVERABLES

1. Source code in a Git repository
1. README.md with:
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples for all features
- Security considerations
- Algorithm explanation
1. List of common passwords (as embedded data or file)
1. Brief security analysis document:
