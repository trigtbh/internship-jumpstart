# PROJECT SPECIFICATION

## CLI Task Management System

**Project Code:** RUST-SEC-001  
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Team:** Developer Productivity Tools  
**Stakeholder:** Internal Engineering Teams

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our engineering teams need a lightweight, fast command-line task management tool that can be used without internet connectivity. Current web-based solutions are too heavyweight for quick task tracking during development workflows.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Build a command-line task management application in Rust that allows developers to quickly capture, track, and manage tasks directly from their terminal.

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Must Have (P0)

- **FR-1:** Users can add new tasks with a description
- **FR-2:** Users can list all tasks with their status (pending/complete)
- **FR-3:** Users can mark tasks as complete by ID or index
- **FR-4:** Users can delete tasks by ID or index
- **FR-5:** Tasks must persist between application runs (save to file)

### Should Have (P1)

- **FR-6:** Each task displays a unique ID
- **FR-7:** Tasks show creation timestamp
- **FR-8:** User-friendly error messages for invalid commands

### Nice to Have (P2)

- **FR-9:** Color-coded output (green for complete, yellow for pending)
- **FR-10:** Ability to filter tasks by status

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Technology

- **Language:** Rust (latest stable version)
- **Storage:** Plain text file or JSON format
- **File Location:** `~/.tasks.json` or similar

### Code Quality Standards

- Proper error handling using `Result<T, E>` types
- No unwrap() calls without justification
- Clear function and variable names
- Comments explaining non-obvious logic

### Data Structure

Each task should contain:

- Unique identifier (numeric or UUID)
- Description (string)
- Status (pending/completed)
- Creation timestamp

## USER INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS

### Command Structure

```
task add "Task description"
task list
task complete <id>
task delete <id>
```

### Expected Output Format

```
$ task list
[1] [ ] Buy groceries (Created: 2025-12-20 14:30)
[2] [✓] Finish project proposal (Created: 2025-12-20 09:15)
```

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. ✅ Application compiles without warnings
1. ✅ All P0 requirements implemented and tested
1. ✅ Data persists correctly after application restart
1. ✅ Invalid commands display helpful error messages
1. ✅ Code follows Rust idioms and best practices

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

- Manual testing of all commands
- Test error cases (invalid IDs, missing file, etc.)
- Verify data persistence across sessions

## DELIVERABLES

1. Source code in a Git repository
1. README.md with:
- Build instructions
- Usage examples
- Architecture overview
1. Working executable

## SUCCESS METRICS

- All P0 requirements met
- Application responds within 100ms for all operations
- Zero data loss during normal operation

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By completing this project, you will understand:

- Rust ownership and borrowing
- Error handling with Result types
- File I/O operations
- Working with structs and enums
- Command-line argument parsing
- JSON serialization/deserialization
